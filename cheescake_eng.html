    <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px; text-align: left">
      Many are convinced that the original recipe is English, but not everyone
      knows what the true origin is and we are sure that discovering it will
      surprise you. <br />
      Where was the cheesecake born and who should we thank for this sweet
      invention? <br />
      The first cheese cake we have memory of was served to athletes during the
      Olympic Games. But we are not talking about the modern Olympics in Atlanta
      or London, but about the ancient ones that took place in Greece. <br />
      In fact, in the eighth century A.C., according to what Callimachus tells
      us, there was a man, Egimio, who had dabbled with the drafting of a text
      entirely dedicated to the art of making cheese cakes, ancestors of the
      cheesecake cake. <br />
      The passion of the Greeks for cheesecake is also confirmed by historians
      who tell us that, in 776 a.C., on the island of Delos athletes were
      refreshed with a cake made with sheep's cheese and honey.
