<p style="color: #86233f ; font-size: 30 px;"> DESCRIPTION </p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 10 px"> The Milanese is an evergreen dish that everyone always likes, from children to adults. There are those who prefer it thin and crunchy, or those who love it tall, with the bone and slightly pink inside. This is precisely the case of one of the best chefs in Lombardy, whom today we hosted with great honor in the kitchen of GialloZafferano: Claudio Sadler. The chef explained to us all the secrets to obtain a perfect Milanese rib. Unlike the Viennese, made with pork, the Milanese cutlet is prepared with tender veal which has a more delicate taste. The secret will all lie in the double breading: with a few gestures and thanks to cooking in abundant clarified butter, the breading will become crunchy and will remain firmly attached to the meat, without detaching during cooking. An easy-to-prepare second course, accompanied by tasty ratte potatoes. A symbol of the cuisine of the Lombard capital, which will conquer all your guests! </p>
