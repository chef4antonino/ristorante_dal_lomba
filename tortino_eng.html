      The soft heart cake has become a bit of an icon of Valentine's Day, and of
      romanticism in general, but perhaps not many know who the creator of this
      dessert is. The coulant, more commonly known as a soft heart cake, was the
      brainchild of Michel Bras, a three-time starred French chef. After two
      years of trying to tell the recipe, the recipe takes its current shape
      1981 with "a pride experienced occasionally in the life of a chef", as'
      himself. In the original version the cake is made up of two parts: a
      crunchy shell made of bisque dough and a frozen chocolate ganache inserted

      stroke of a teaspoon. A fascinating show, an ecstasy of the senses ". The

      With a delicate but at the same time very decisive flavor, the pie turns
      out to be very good on the palate, also thanks to the contrast between
      crunchy casing and warm and soft heart.</p2
